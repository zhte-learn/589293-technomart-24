# Study Project: "Technomart"

This project was created as part of the professional online course "HTML and CSS, Level 1" by HTML Academy. During the course, special emphasis was placed on semantic HTML, flexbox layout, and styling checkboxes. The layout is not responsive. The project also features functionality implemented with JavaScript, including a modal window, slider, and tabs.
